## Problem Statement

### The Problem

International and ESL students face significant barriers when attending lectures in a language that is not their native tongue. According to UNESCO, over 6 million students study abroad annually, with the majority attending institutions where instruction is delivered in a second language. These students often:

- Miss critical lecture content due to processing delays when mentally translating
- Struggle to connect spoken concepts with course materials written in the instruction language
- Spend excessive time post-lecture trying to reconstruct what was said
- Experience cognitive fatigue from constant translation effort, reducing comprehension and retention
- Hesitate to ask questions in class due to language barriers

### Current Solutions Gap

Existing solutions fail to address the complete problem:

| Solution                     | Limitation                                              |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Live human interpreters      | Expensive, not scalable, unavailable for most courses   |
| Post-lecture transcription   | No real-time benefit; students still lost during class  |
| Generic translation apps     | No course context; cannot align with learning materials |
| Recorded lecture translation | Delays learning; no immediate engagement                |

### AI-First Justification

Rosetta requires sophisticated multi-model AI orchestration that goes far beyond basic API calls:

1. **Parallel Speech Processing**: Simultaneous speech-to-text (for transcription/RAG) and text translation with TTS (for audio output)
2. **Real-Time Semantic Understanding**: Sliding window processing of transcript for contextual RAG queries
3. **Optimized RAG Pipeline**: KeyBERT keyword extraction, local BGE embeddings, ChromaDB search, and TinyBERT cross-encoder re-ranking
4. **Citation Alignment**: Matching English course materials to translated output with page references
5. **Intelligent Summarization**: LLM-powered note generation that preserves structure and citations

This multi-stage pipeline creates genuine AI-first value that cannot be replicated with simple API wrappers.

### Impact

- **Educational Equity**: Levels the playing field for non-native speakers
- **Accessibility**: Addresses a real barrier faced by millions of students globally
- **Learning Outcomes**: Improved comprehension and retention through native-language delivery plus contextual materials
- **Cognitive Load Reduction**: Students focus on learning, not translating
- **Classroom Participation**: Question translation enables students to participate actively

## Product Description

Rosetta is a web application that transforms the lecture experience for students facing language barriers. The system operates in real-time during live lectures, providing three parallel outputs:

1. **Translated Audio**: Natural-sounding speech in the student's preferred language, delivered through their device speakers or headphones
2. **Live Transcription Display**: Real-time voice-to-text transcription appearing dynamically as the professor speaks, displayed in a visual panel
3. **Contextual Citations**: Relevant course materials automatically surfaced based on what the professor is discussing

After the lecture concludes, students can generate comprehensive, structured notes that combine the full translated transcript with all citations, formatted for effective study and review. Notes are organized within a folder-based system for easy access and management.

### Design Principles

- **Real-Time First**: Every feature prioritizes low latency for live lecture use
- **Context-Aware**: RAG pipeline connects spoken content to uploaded course materials
- **Accessibility-Native**: Multi-sensory output (audio + visual) with screen reader support
- **Privacy-Conscious**: Session data managed with clear retention policies
- **Material Design**: Sleek, modern UI built with Material UI components

## Technical Architecture

### Hybrid Architecture Overview

Rosetta uses a **hybrid architecture** combining Convex (serverless backend) for data operations with FastAPI for ML/AI services:

- **Convex**: Authentication, database (CRUD), real-time subscriptions, file storage
- **FastAPI**: ML models, RAG pipeline, translation streaming, TTS integration

This separation allows us to leverage Convex's real-time capabilities and seamless React integration while maintaining FastAPI's strength in ML model hosting and streaming audio.

### Backend Architecture Pattern

The backend follows the Controller-Service-Repository pattern with dependency injection for clean separation of concerns and testability.

**Controller Layer:** Handles API endpoint definitions and request/response handling. Routes requests to appropriate services.

**Service Layer:** Contains business logic and orchestration. Coordinates between external APIs and repositories.

**Repository Layer:** Abstracts data access. Provides clean interface for vector database, relational database, and file storage operations.

**Data Transfer Objects (DTOs):** All API contracts use Pydantic models for validation and documentation.

## User Interface Design

### Design Philosophy

The interface follows Material Design principles with a modern, accessible aesthetic. The UI prioritizes clarity and usability during live lecture scenarios, with a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes. The design emphasizes high contrast for accessibility and provides a clean workspace that minimizes cognitive load while maximizing information density.

### Main Application View

The primary interface uses a three-panel layout to support simultaneous consumption of multiple information streams:

**Left Panel - Navigation and Content Management:**
Contains folder-based organization for courses and sessions, along with document management capabilities. Users can browse their session history, create new folders, and manage uploaded course materials.

**Center Panel - Live Transcription with In-Text Citations:**
The largest area of the screen displays real-time transcription of the professor's speech. Text appears dynamically as speech is detected, with automatic scrolling to keep the latest content visible. Citations appear inline as superscript numbers (e.g., "...fundamental theorem of calculus...<sup>1, 2, 3</sup>") with relevance-based styling where more relevant citations appear darker. Timestamp markers help orient students within the lecture timeline. The question translation assistant is accessible from this panel.

**Right Panel - Citation Details:**
Displays detailed information about the in-text citations. When users hover over or click citation numbers in the transcription, this panel shows the corresponding document names, page references, and content previews. Users can click through to view full document content.

**Bottom Control Bar:**
Provides session controls including recording status, playback controls, volume adjustment, and quick access to note generation.

### Note Editor View

The note editing interface provides a full-featured text editing workspace. A toolbar offers formatting options and includes the "Structure into Notes" button for LLM-powered note generation. The editor supports rich text editing with Markdown, with an export option to generate PDF versions of completed notes.

- **Screen Reader Support**: ARIA labels and semantic HTML throughout
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full functionality without mouse
- **High Contrast Mode**: User-configurable display settings
- **Font Scaling**: Adjustable transcription and citation text size
- **Material UI Accessibility**: Built-in a11y compliance from component library

### Bias Mitigation

- **Accent Testing**: Validate translation quality across diverse speaker accents
- **Language Pair Quality**: Acknowledge varying quality across language pairs
- **Feedback Mechanism**: Allow users to flag translation errors for improvement

### Responsible AI Practices

- **Human Oversight**: Users can pause, review, and correct translations
- **No Permanent Recording**: Audio is processed in real-time, not recorded
- **Consent**: Clear user consent before microphone activation
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse of external APIs
